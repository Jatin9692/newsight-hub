  <section itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In a dramatic escalation of the <strong>war iran-israel</strong>, the <strong>USA</strong> launched "Operation Midnight Hammer" on June 22, targeting three Iranian nuclear sites—Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. These strikes were reportedly intended to disrupt Iran’s potential nuclear breakout capabilities.</p>

    <p>Just hours later on June 23, <strong>Iran</strong> retaliated by launching missiles at the Al Udeid Air Base in <strong>Qatar</strong>, a major <strong>USA</strong> military installation. All incoming missiles were intercepted successfully, and no casualties were reported.</p>

    <p>On June 24, former President <strong>Trump</strong> made a surprise announcement on Truth Social, declaring a phased <strong>ceasefire</strong>: Iran would halt its operations first, followed by Israel 12 hours later. Trump credited Qatar’s Prime Minister for facilitating talks behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>However, Iran’s officials stated they would only honor the ceasefire if Israel did not respond with further “illegal aggression.” Sporadic missile exchanges continued even after Trump’s statement, casting doubt on the truce’s effectiveness.</p>
