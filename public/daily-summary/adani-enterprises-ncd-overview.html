  <h3>What You Need to Know</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Issuer & Size:</strong> Adani Enterprises Ltd is raising <strong>₹1,000 crore</strong> via non‑convertible debentures (NCDs).</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> <strong>75%</strong> of proceeds earmarked for <strong>prepayment</strong> of existing debt; remaining for general corporate needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Terms:</strong> Up to <strong>9.30% yield</strong>, maximum <strong>60‑month tenor</strong>, rated <strong>'AA' (stable)</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Context:</strong> Net external debt jumped from ₹30,966 crore to ₹49,306 crore in one year; net debt/EBITDA rose from 2.3× to 2.9×.</li>
    <li><strong>Market Signal:</strong> Prior ₹800 crore NCD fully subscribed on Day 1; reflects strong investor appetite.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1. Background & Context</h3>
  <p>
    Adani Enterprises Ltd (AEL), the flagship operating arm of the Adani Group, faces rising leverage: its net external debt surged ~59% year‑on‑year, pushing its net debt/EBITDA ratio to 2.9×. To address high‑cost borrowings and diversify its funding mix, AEL has launched a <strong>₹1,000 crore NCD</strong> issue, opening <strong>July 9</strong> and closing <strong>July 22, 2025</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Key Terms Explained</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Non‑Convertible Debentures (NCDs):</strong> Debts that pay fixed interest and cannot convert into equity. <a href="/glossary/ncd">Learn more</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Yield (up to 9.30%):</strong> Annual return on investment—competitive against FDs (~6.5–7.5%) and government bonds (~6.8%).</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Rating 'AA' (stable):</strong> Indicates very low credit risk (just below AAA).</li>
    <li><strong>Tenor:</strong> Maximum of 60 months (5 years).</li>
    <li><strong>Earmarked for Prepayment:</strong> 75% reserved to repay existing loans early, reducing future interest costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Net Debt/EBITDA Ratio:</strong> Measure of leverage; at 2.9×, it's acceptable but rising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Strategic Rationale & Impact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Debt Reduction:</strong> Early repayment slashes expensive borrowings, strengthens the balance sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of Capital:</strong> NCD yield likely cheaper than some overseas or syndicated loans.</li>
    <li><strong>Retail Participation:</strong> Minimum investment ₹10,000 invites retail investors, deepening domestic debt markets.</li>
    <li><strong>Investor Confidence:</strong> Prior issue's oversubscription and rating stability underpin market trust.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Risks & Watchpoints</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Leverage Trend:</strong> Continued debt growth may push net debt/EBITDA past comfortable thresholds.</li>
    <li><strong>Interest Rate Environment:</strong> Rising rates could erode NCD secondary‑market valuations.</li>
    <li><strong>Group Exposure:</strong> Adani Group's overall leverage and regulatory scrutiny remain factors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Outlook</h3>
  <p class="conclusion">
    AEL's NCD issue is a <strong>proactive step</strong> to manage its debt profile and broaden its investor base. If coupon servicing remains smooth and leverage stabilizes, this could pave the way for more diversified, lower‑cost funding in the future.
