    summary: `<div class="formatted-article-content">
      <p class="lead-paragraph">In a major escalation of Middle East tensions, the United States has joined Israel in bombing three of Iran's key nuclear sitesâ€”Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahanâ€”after weeks of mounting hostilities.</p>
      
      <h2>What's Going On in the iran-israel war?</h2>
      <p>On June 22, 2025, U.S. B-2 stealth bombers and submarine-launched missiles joined Israeli jets in hitting Iran's nuclear facilities. Israel cited new intelligence on Iran's bomb program; President Trump personally authorized U.S. involvement.</p>
      
      <h2>How Trump Ordered U.S. Strikes in the iran-israel war</h2>
      <p>Without seeking Congress, Trump invoked executive war powers. He called it a "spectacular success" and said it "obliterated" Iran's nuclear threat.</p>
      
      <h2>What Was Destroyed in Iran's Nuclear Sites?</h2>
      <p>Precision strikes heavily damaged uranium enrichment halls at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan. Nearby missile and drone factories were also hit to degrade Iran's wider military capacity.</p>
      
      <h2>Who Was Killed in the Warâ€”Key IRGC Figures & Civilians</h2>
      <p>Two senior IRGC generalsâ€”Saeed Izadi and Behnam Shahriyariâ€”were killed. Iran reports 430â€“657 total deaths, including 263+ civilians. Retaliatory Iranian attacks have killed 24+ civilians in Israel.</p>
      
      <p class="conclusion">With U.S. forces now directly involved, the iran-israel war has entered a new phase. The world watches nervously as both sides prepare for possible further escalation.</p>
